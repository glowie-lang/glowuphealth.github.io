  <h1>About Glow Up Health</h1>
  <p>At Glow Up Health, we believe that every young person deserves the chance to glow from the inside out. 🌿✨
  We’re a youth-led organization focused on helping teens and kids understand and take charge of their 
    mental, physical, and emotional health — because feeling good shouldn’t be confusing or out of reach.
  We aim to make health and hygiene feel real, accessible, and even a little fun! From learning about self-care and mindfulness 
    to understanding hygiene basics and emotional well-being, we’re here to help you grow stronger, happier, and more confident every day💖.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>To empower teens and kids to take charge of their overall mental, physical, and emotional health by 
    providing the education, tools, and support they need to thrive, while promoting self-care and hygiene for a healthier, happier life.</p>
</section>

<section class="story fade-in">
  <h2>Our Story🌱 </h2>
  <p> Glow Up Health started in 2024 as H.E.A (Health. Education. Awareness.), a small idea created to help teens and kids 
    learn more about health, hygiene, and self-care.
  After joining the AFS Global STEM Program in 2025, we rebranded to Glow Up Health, 
    a name that better reflects our mission to help young people glow from the inside out. ✨
  We’re still growing, creating, and learning every step of the way — sharing simple, fun, and honest health tips on TikTok and beyond. 🌿💖</p>
